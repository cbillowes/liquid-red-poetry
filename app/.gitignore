## .yarn/patches contain the patchfiles you've been generating with the yarn patch-commit command.
## You always want them in your repository, since they are necessary to install your dependencies.
!.yarn/patches

## .yarn/plugins and .yarn/releases contain the Yarn releases used in the current repository (as defined by yarn set version).
## You will want to keep them versioned (this prevents potential issues if, say, two engineers use different Yarn versions
## with different features).
!.yarn/plugins
!.yarn/releases

## (Optional):
## .yarn/sdks contains the editor SDKs generated by @yarnpkg/sdks.
## Whether to keep it in your repository or not is up to you; if you don't, you'll need to follow the editor procedure again on
## new clones. See Editor SDKs for more details.
## https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/editor-sdks
!.yarn/sdks

## .yarn/versions is used by the version plugin to store the package release definitions.
